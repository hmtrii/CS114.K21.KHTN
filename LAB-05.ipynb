Provincial regulatory colleges are complying with the Canadian Pharmacists Association call to limit the amount of medications given to patients to 30-day supplies. The goal is to stop people from refilling prescriptions early and to ensure life-saving drugs don't run short when supply chains are vulnerable. Mina Tadrous is a pharmacist and researcher in Toronto who monitors pharmaceutical supplies. He is worried Canadians will start stockpiling drugs after watching what has been unfolding in the U.S. and other regions as the virus spreads.  He said pharmacists are concerned about drugs such as life-saving inhalers that people might stockpile based on misinformation circulating about potential treatments for COVID-19. \"\"It's that relationship of how people are reacting rather than the actual supply of medications,\"\" he said.  Tadrous said pharmacies get their medications and supplies from wholesalers, who get theirs from distributors who source them from manufacturers. Outside of wholesalers, most of that supply chain is outside of Canada.  Ongoing shortages Dr. Jacalyn Duffin of Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., has long warned about the increasing frequency of drug shortages, including nearly 2,000 ongoing shortages, none of which she attributes to coronavirus. China and India produce 80 per cent of the active ingredients of prescription drugs sold in North America, said Dr. Jacalyn Duffin. (Kas Roussy/CBC) Given that China and India produce 80 per cent of the active ingredients of prescription drugs sold in North America, supply disruptions are expected eventually, Duffin said. \"\"I think that the coronavirus outbreak is a big wake-up call for us to pay attention to our drug shortages that exist already and to pay attention to where our drugs come from,\"\" she said. What you need to know about getting new prescriptions, refillsNew Brunswick offers relief on prescription co-pays during outbreak India, a major supplier of generic drugs to Europe, has already shut down the export of some antibiotics and drugs for hypertension, blood pressure and acetaminophen, Duffin said.

The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike it has ever faced. The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared sombre and exhausted as he announced the vote — and he released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed. \"\"The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis,\"\" said Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"\"Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick. Our workers are without work. Our businesses cannot do business. Our factories lie idle. The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt.\"\" WATCH | U.S. closer to passing aid package as Louisiana becomes potential hotspot: American lawmakers are confident an aid package will be approved this week as officials identify Louisiana as a possible hotspot for COVID-19 cases. 1:59 The package is intended as relief for an economy spiralling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: \"\"We've anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won't need this for three months.\"\" Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget. Insistently optimistic, President Donald Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone's lifetime, \"\"I don't think its going to end up being such a rough patch\"\" and anticipated the economy soaring \"\"like a rocket ship\"\" when it's over. Coronavirus impact spreads across U.S., with much of the population under stay-at-home ordersAnyone leaving New York must self-isolate or risk spreading COVID-19, health officials say The drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states who economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes, saying the legislation as written might give workers like store clerks incentives to stay on unemployment instead of returning return to their jobs since they may earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision. Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said, \"\"I'm telling you, these numbers don't work.\"\" Ardent liberals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were restless as well, but top Washington Democrats assured them that a additional coronavirus legislation will follow this spring and signalled that delaying the pending measure would be foolish. The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. Provides direct payments Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi swung behind the bipartisan agreement, saying it \"\"takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people.\"\" Senate passage delivered the legislation to the Democratic-controlled House, which will most likely pass it Friday. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber was unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. It includes a controversial, heavily negotiated $500 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. Six days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure is not an option, nor is starting over, which permitted both sides to include their priorities. \"\"That Washington drama does not matter any more,\"\" McConnell said. \"\"The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.\"\" U.S. Capitol Police officers stand atop of the U.S. Senate stairway, ahead of a vote on the coronavirus relief bill, on Capitol Hill in Washington Wednesday.  (Tom Brenner/Reuters) The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks to an estimated $130 billion. Another $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services. Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Republicans won inclusion of an \"\"employee retention\"\" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 per cent of workers' paycheque up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 per cent Social Security payroll tax.\",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/senate-coronavirus-relief-bill-1.5510475\n",

The response has been especially rapid as the virus has spread unchecked across the globe. Still, any treatments are a long way from being proven both effective and safe, and most certainly won't come in time to address the current pandemic. According to some of the top infectious disease experts in the world, even on an accelerated timeline, a vaccine is still likely 12-18 months away — and then the challenge will be producing enough to make it readily available. There is currently no drug therapy or vaccine approved anywhere in the world for COVID-19. Here are the latest developments in the research.

The trial, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Minnesota, University of Alberta and McGill University Health Centre, will include participants who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who live with someone who has. Long-term use of hydroxychloroquine is known to cause cardiac and eye toxicity, but Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine, said the short five-day trial should be \"\"very safe.\"\"  Manitoba researchers begin clinical trial with drug they hope can help in COVID-19 fight  \"\"The idea is to reduce the severity of symptoms,\"\" said Zarychanski, a critical care doctor, \"\"and also reduce the transmissibility of the virus and reduce community spread, which can help keep our population more healthy and reduce the burden that we're expecting on the health care system.\"\" But experts, including Canada's chief public health officer, warn that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side-effects. They also say there is a danger that hoarding the medication could hurt the many patients who take it for chronic inflammatory diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  Canadian doctors urge caution on repurposing malaria medication to fight COVID-19  March 25: New York's Mount Sinai hospital begins treating critically ill COVID-19 patients via plasmapheresis, a century-old therapy that involves removing antibody-rich plasma from blood and returning it to a patient (the same or another) after either treating it or replacing it.

(Trevor Brine/CBC) Trudeau says rules of Quarantine Act will be enforced to keep people isolated  A new order requiring travellers returning to Canada from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days is the latest measure from a government trying to deal with both a rise in COVID-19 cases and the growing economic fallout. \"\"We are implementing the Quarantine Act to keep all Canadians safe,\"\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today, calling decisions by some to ignore the call to self-isolate for two weeks \"\"disappointing\"\" and \"\"dangerous.\"\" When asked why the quarantine measure wasn't introduced sooner, Trudeau said \"\"the vast majority\"\" of Canadians have been following public health guidelines and taking the precautions necessary to protect themselves and others. But, he said, \"\"there have been too many people who have not,\"\" which required the use of a rule with enforcement measures. There have been questions about whether the government's measures at the border to date have been strict enough, furthering concern that some returning travellers weren't complying with the self-isolation request. Premiers, including Ontario's Doug Ford and Alberta's Jason Kenney, addressed that concern earlier this week, prior to the mandatory measure from Ottawa.

The source stressed that the U.S. hasn't made a final decision. Canada and the U.S. have a mutual ban in place on non-essential travel across the border, which includes trips for recreational purposes. When that ban was announced, both sides stressed the importance of continuing to allow trade, commerce and cross-border essential workers to move back and forth over the border.

Anything you've ever been curious about you can now dig into and really get it squared away in your mind.\"\" THE SCIENCE What are the riskiest surfaces for coronavirus? In general, surfaces are riskier if they are smooth, such as metal or plastic (although copper-containing metals are antimicrobial and can kill viruses more quickly). Viruses generally don't survive as long on porous surfaces like paper or clothing. Surfaces that are touched a lot by a lot of people —such as doorknobs, faucets and phones — are generally riskier as well. Studies have detected coronaviruses on phones, doorknobs, computer mice, toilet handles, latex gloves and sponges in hospital and apartments. The Public Health Agency of Canada, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization recommend that you wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or use hand sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol if soap and water aren't available). You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. In public places, you should avoid touching surfaces. If you have to touch something, you can use disinfectant wipes to wipe off surfaces that are touched frequently by other people, like grocery cart handles, Ottawa epidemiologist Dr. Rama Nair recommends.

Scientists believe the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 emerged from one of these wildlife markets — also known as \"\"wet markets\"\" — in the Chinese city of Wuhan, possibly through an infected bat. Bats are just one of the animals that are sold at these markets, where customers come to purchase domestic livestock and wildlife, including pigs, chickens, civet cats, bamboo rats, porcupines and pangolins. But Bowman said shutting down such markets may prove extremely challenging, as these cultural practices date back thousands of years and have become part of a multi-billion-dollar global industry. Experts call for global ban on live animal markets, wildlife trade amidst coronavirus outbreakWhy tracing the animal source of coronavirus matters Spillover event Bowman said the main concern with these markets is a spillover event, when viruses transfer from one species to another and then cross over to humans. On very rare occasions, humans will transmit that virus from one person to another, which is what occurred with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and, by all indications, is happening with COVID-19. WATCH | An explainer on where the coronavirus came from It started with animal to human transmission. But the novel coronavirus is now spreading between people. 0:25 \"\"Mathematically, this is not a common occurrence. But if you actually wanted to create a laboratory-like experiment to design the conditions for a spillover event, you would create the kind of wildlife market that you have in China,\"\" Bowman said. In a recent video message about COVID-19, famed primatologist Jane Goodall warned that the close relationship between people and wild animals in these markets \"\"has unleashed the terror and misery of new viruses.\"\" SARS may have spread to humans through wild mammals. The Ebola epidemics in west and central Africa are thought to have originated from bats, while Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is suspected to have come from camels. All of these infected animals were in wildlife markets, where every day millions of people around the world still get their food. Not just in China Bowman emphasized that China is not the only culprit, nor is Asia \"\"the only continent in the world that has this challenge.\"\" \"\"But it's particularly tenacious in the Far East, and extends into Vietnam, a lot of Southeast Asia, Indonesia,\"\" he said. Civet cats wait for food at a farm in Liuan, China.  (China Photos/Getty Images) In February, China announced a ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals. But it also imposed tough restrictions following the SARS outbreak in 2003, only to see the industry slowly re-emerge. Many environmentalists say such bans contain loopholes. The selling of wild animals accounts for \"\"a significant portion of the economy. And it has created an economic opportunity for a lot of people,\"\" Bowman said. There are different estimates, but Bowman said the size of the global wildlife trade is pegged at somewhere between $7 billion to $23 billion US a year. Animals in unsanitary conditions Bowman, who conducts research on this issue, said when he last visited a market in Wuhan, he counted 57 species of animals, about two-thirds of them wild, mostly of Asian origin. Cages were stacked on top of each other, in unsanitary conditions. He said operators had \"\"high-powered hoses that are blasting around urine, feces, blood from one cage to another to another to another.\"\" In terms of the general concepts of infectious diseases, wildlife markets are \"\"a perfect opportunity for the mixing of bacteria and viruses as well as transmission to other groups,\"\" said Jason Stull, assistant professor at the University of Prince Edward Island's Atlantic Veterinary College. Not only that, but stress and malnutrition reduce the immune system of animals and potentially exacerbate this problem, Stull said. For example, an animal under duress may be more likely to shed higher amounts of virus. \"\"All of these things likely can contribute to movement back and forth of diseases,\"\" Stull said. Many infectious diseases linked to wildlife According to the EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based organization that conducts scientific research into emerging infectious diseases, about three-fourths of all such diseases are somehow linked to wildlife. William Karesh, executive vice president for health and policy at the EcoHealth Alliance, said the current coronavirus outbreak was likely spread in two possible ways. It could have been a wild animal being sold in the market that contaminated the market. It's also possible that a vendor in the market was infected somewhere else and then infected their customers. The animals that end up in the market are coming from two places — hunted in the wild or bred on farms. WATCH | How bats likely spread the novel coronavirus  Bowman said there are deep cultural roots with this industry — thousands of years of tradition of eating wild animals. As well, the animals are used for traditional Chinese medicine, luxury goods and the pet trade. \"\"What's really changed is that this has gone from occasional domestic use with emerging populations in combination with the burgeoning wealth to a massive commercial enterprise,\"\" Bowman said. Focus should be on education Karesh said ending these practices will take time, likely generations, and can only be done through education and helping countries improve their food systems. He suggested that instead of banning all wildlife trade, countries should focus on those animals that are more likely to have viruses that can be transmitted to humans — like rodents, bats and non-human primates. He said the international community must come to grips with the growing and unsustainable use of wildlife, or we will \"\"continue to see pandemics.\"\" \"\"There are three to five emerging diseases every year, and only by luck and the grace of God ... they don't turn into pandemics each time.\"\"\",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/wildlife-markets-china-coronavirus-pandemic-1.5510045\n",

The Ottawa Hospital is doubling its number of intensive care beds and seeking donations of masks and other personal protective equipment at coviddonations@toh.ca.  Doctors, nurses and cleaning staff in Ottawa are already starting to ration disposable masks to conserve the current supply.  The Montfort and Queensway Carleton hospitals are preparing to open up urgent care centres for COVID-19 patients.  LISTEN: Critical care clinics 'ready to be opened' if needed   Dr. Andrew Willmore, medical director of emergency management at the Ottawa Hospital, says there are several care centres standing by in case of a rise in COVID-19 cases. 0:49 Public health officials say there's still time to slow the spread of COVID-19 if residents keep up physical distancing or self-isolation orders and recommendations, if required.  Physical distancing means avoiding non-essential trips out, working from home and cancelling gatherings, even with friends or extended family. Ottawa Public Health advises residents to only be with members of their own household and stay at least two metres away from everyone else. LISTEN: 'Too soon to say' how social distancing is affecting COVID-19 spread In a news conference conducted by telephone, Vera Etches, Ottawa’s chief medical officer of health, says a delay in getting test results and the continuing return of travellers from abroad make it too early to say how social distancing measures are affecting the spread of COVID-19. 0:42 Public health officials are also urging anyone who's had close contact with someone who has travelled outside the country to self-solate for 14 days. That means staying home for two weeks and asking relatives, friends or neighbours to deliver groceries, medication and other supplies. All deliveries should be left at the door to maintain a two-metre distance. People who feel sick should also self-isolate for 14 days or until 24 hours after their symptoms are gone, whichever is longer. Travellers who return to Canada must now enter a mandatory 14-day period of self-isolation or face a fine of up to $750,000, or as much as six months in jail, unless they're an essential worker. Many municipalities have declared states of emergency.

Vera Etches said the virus could infect 4,000 people a day at its peak if physical distancing and self-isolation recommendations aren't respected. Ontario has 993 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Quebec has 2,021 presumptive and confirmed cases. Fifty-three deaths in Canada have been linked to COVID-19, including 18 each in Ontario and Quebec.   What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Symptoms of COVID-19 range from a very mild, cold-like illness to a severe lung infection. The most common symptoms include fever, fatigue and a dry cough. They may take up to 14 days to appear, which is why that's the period of self-isolation. Older people, those with compromised immune systems and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness. WATCH: Here's how Canadians are helping each other through the pandemic How Canadians across the country are helping each other through the COVID-19 pandemic. 3:04 The coronavirus primarily spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread through close, prolonged contact, such as touching or handshaking, and via surfaces such as door handles, mobile phones, tables and light switches if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth before washing their hands. When to get tested Anyone in Ottawa who has a new or worsening cough or fever and has travelled outside Canada, or has been in contact with a confirmed case, should go to the COVID-19 screening centre at the Brewer Arena. The centre is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily at 151 Brewer Way, off Bronson Avenue near Carleton University. You don't have to call ahead.  If you meet some of the criteria but don't have symptoms, you won't be tested and should self-isolate for 14 days. If you have severe symptoms, call 911. WATCH: Ottawa homeless shelters trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 Wendy Muckle, executive director of Ottawa Inner City Health, says shelters are taking as many precautions as possible to limit the spread of COVID-19, but with so many shelters near or at capacity, social distancing is still a challenge. 0:57 In western Quebec: Gatineau's downtown assessment location is at 135 blvd. Saint-Raymond. Outaouais resident should call the regional help line at 819-644-4545 if they have a cough or fever, whether they've travelled or not. If your symptoms require a trip to the emergency room, call ahead if your condition allows to let them know your travel history.  Kingston, Ont. The assessment centre in Kingston is now at the Kingston Memorial Centre at 303 York St. It is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. If you develop mild to moderate symptoms after travelling, either contact your health-care provider or go to the test site. Kingston's public health unit says to check its website for information, and call Telehealth at 1-866-797-0000 with any remaining questions. Other communities The public health unit in the Belleville, Ont., area is asking people only call it at 613-966-5500 if they've checked the website and still have questions. The same advice goes for Leeds, Grenville and Lanark's unit at 1-800-660-5853 extension 2499. It opened a testing site by referral only at the Brockville Memorial Centre at 100 Magedoma Blvd. that's open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Referrals can come from a family doctor or the public health unit and will only be given to the sick and people who have left the country or been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Hawkesbury, Ont., has an assessment centre at 750 Laurier St. open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.  Like Ottawa, only go there if you have new or worsening symptoms and have travelled or been in contact with a confirmed case. Go to CHEO if you're looking after an infant younger than six months old that fits this description. Self-isolate if you have mild symptoms, go to the hospital if your symptoms are severe. Only people older than age 70, who have chronic health problems or compromised immune systems can call 613-933-1375 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to ask about a home visit from paramedics.

Call Telehealth​​​, their health care provider or it at 613-735-8654 if they still have more questions. Anyone who doesn't have or can't reach a family doctor can call its new primary care centre at 1-844-727-6404 if they have questions about their health. The province of Ontario generally advises people experiencing symptoms to call Telehealth or their health care provider. There has been a lag of four days or more to get Ontario's test results, with more being done per day than can be processed.  The province says it's doubling its testing capacity by the end of the week and nearly quadrupling that by mid-April. In the Outaouais, the local health agency is calling anyone whose tests take more than a week to get back to them. It said its goal is a result in 24 to 48 hours. First Nations communities The Mohawk communities of Akwesasne and Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte (MBQ) have declared a state of emergency to prepare for possible cases. Anyone in MBQ who has symptoms can call 613-967-3603 to talk to a nurse. A home test may be possible after that. In Akwesasne, community members are asked to carry their status cards when crossing the Canada-U.S. border for essential trips. The Algonquin communities of Kitigan Zibi and Pikwakanagan have scaled back non-essential services and are asking residents to follow public health advice.

The university said Thursday at least 1,209 people in the U.S. have died from the disease caused by the coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospitals and government authorities in New York, New Orleans and other hot spots grappled with a dire shortage of supplies, staff and sick beds. Medical facilities were running short of ventilators and protective masks, and were being hampered by limited testing capacity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an increase of 13,987 cases and 257 deaths in its most recent measuring period, between Tuesday and Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET. The increases in the previous 24-hour period were 144 deaths and about 11,000 new cases. To help businesses deal with the outbreak, the Trump administration has decided it will be easing back on environmental enforcement and compliance requirements, according to an Environmental Protection Agency memo. The decision follows requests by the energy industry and other sectors. AnalysisPoliticians who consider sacrificing the old for the sake of the economy face a backlash: Don PittisNo, the new coronavirus wasn't created in a lab, scientists say \"\"In general, the EPA does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the EPA agrees that COVID-19 was the cause,\"\" the EPA memo read. On the same day — seemingly responding to an unprecedented stimulus awaiting approval by the U.S. House of Representatives — Wall Street rallied for a third straight session. The S&P 500 gained 154.51 points, or 6.24 per cent, and the Dow Jones rose 1,351.62 points, or 6.38 per cent. Those gains capped off the largest three-day percentage gains since 1931 and 1933 respectively, while the Dow's rise of more than 20 per cent since March 23 meets some analysts' definition of a bull market. New York as the U.S. epicentre More than one-third of COVID-19 fatalities in the United States have been in New York state, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned hospitals could soon run out of beds and ventilators. In his daily news conference Thursday, Cuomo said that 385 have died in the state from the virus, an increase from the previous day of 100. He said the goal was to get to a hospital-bed capacity of 140,000, up from the current 53,000 available Authorities were scouting new sites to build temporary facilities, he said.

The federal government was sending \"\"everything we can\"\" to help New York, including ventilators, gloves and protective masks for use in hospitals, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said. \"\"But we've also got an emerging problem in New Orleans. We got Detroit, we've got Chicago, Seattle, California, my home state. Like I said, there's planes in the air everywhere now,\"\" Navarro added. THE LATESTCoronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on March 26Canada 'strongly opposed' to U.S. stationing troops near shared border Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the acceleration of cases in New York \"\"quite disturbing.\"\" He also warned that the virus could return for the next northern winter. \"\"We hope we get a respite as we get into April, May and June. It is likely to come around next season because it's a very vigorous virus,\"\" Fauci told WNYC public radio during an interview in New York on Thursday. New York's neighbour is also dealing with a surge in cases. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said cases there had increased by nearly 2,500 from the previous day, with the death toll spiking from 19 to 81. Rural Georgia, Louisiana dealing with spikes The rampant infections in New York City have dominated much of the national conversation about the disease. But far from the coasts, smaller communities are also preparing for things to get worse, as they have in Albany, Ga. The largest hospital in Georgia's mostly rural, southwest corner is rapidly running out of space amid the highest rate of coronavirus infection in the entire state.

(Jonathan Bachman/Reuters) \"\"I can't tell you how it's going to be Friday, much less in the week after,\"\" said Scott Steiner, CEO of the four-hospital health system that includes Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany. At Phoebe Putney, intensive care beds are filled with COVID-19 patients and employees are hand-sewing masks to help stretch dwindling supplies. Roughly 90,000 people live in Albany and surrounding Dougherty County. The virus's impact has been outsized compared with the community's population. Infections countywide have surpassed 100, including seven deaths, making it Georgia's hardest-hit county outside metro Atlanta. In New Orleans, doctors and hospital officials are seeing an increased number of patients needing intensive care and are working to avoid the possible overwhelming of their systems. Louisiana officials are considering housing patients in hotels and a convention centre in the city. \"\"We are seeing an escalation in cases across our system,\"\" said Warner Thomas, chief executive at Ochsner Medical Center, Louisiana's largest hospital system. Underscoring the threat to health-care workers striving to cope with the pandemic, Thomas said 300 Ochsner employees were under quarantine, including 60 diagnosed with COVID-19. Fed chair is listening to pandemic experts Hospitals, laid-off workers and struggling companies will receive badly needed economic aid under the record-setting relief bill approved by the U.S. Senate late on Wednesday in a 96-0 vote. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she expects that her chamber will approve the bill in a strong bipartisan vote on Friday. President Donald Trump has said he would sign the bill into law. Americans should receive direct deposits for financial aid within three weeks as soon as the bill is signed into law, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday.   U.S. Senate passes $2T coronavirus relief packageU.S. jobless claims soared to record 3.2M last week as COVID-19 crisis took hold Jobless claims soared to a record 3.3 million on Thursday, nearly five times the previous weekly record of 695,000 from the recession of 1982. The report may understate the problem as the official statistics typically have not included the self-employed or independent contractors. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the United States already \"\"may well be in recession.\"\" Powell warned that reactivating the economy would have to wait until the virus was under control, despite Trump's stated desire to resume economic activity by Easter, April 12. \"\"The first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity,\"\" Powell told NBC's Today Show. Danni Askini had to fight tooth and nail just to get tested for the coronavirus. Now she's fighting to cover the cost of her treatment. 7:32 Powell said he expects economic activity \"\"to resume and move back up in the second half of the year,\"\" but that the board was paying attention to the warnings of experts like Fauci.  Most confirmed U.S. military cases are domestic The U.S. military, meanwhile, has decided it will stop providing some of the more granular data about coronavirus infections within its ranks. U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he wanted some of the more mission-specific information to be withheld to prevent compromising operational security. \"\"I'm not going to get into a habit where we start providing numbers across all the commands and we come to a point six, seven weeks from now where we have some concerns in some locations and reveal information that could put people at risk,\"\" said Esper. Officials told Reuters there are more domestic cases than among forces overseas. About 85 per cent of confirmed coronavirus cases in the air force were of personnel in the U.S., while the navy said roughly 90 per cent of its cases were located domestically. Esper noted that commanders overseas have greater ability to impose restrictions on the movement of troops and their families.\",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-coronavirus-thursday-1.5510581\n"
